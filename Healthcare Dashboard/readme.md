# Financial Dashboard

## Problem Statement:
Creating a healthcare dashboard that offers real-time monitoring of essential KPIs is essential to enhance hospital performance and patient satisfaction. The challenge is to develop an intuitive and dynamic platform that enables healthcare professionals to access and utilize critical patient statistics effectively.

## KPIs include :
-Number of Stays:
 The total count of patient stays recorded in the system.

-Number of Patients:
The total count of distinct patients who have stayed at the hospital.

-Patient Per Stay:
The average number of patients per stay, calculated as the total number of patients divided by the total number of stays.

-Total Cost Weight:
The sum of cost weights associated with all patient stays.

-Cost Weight Per Stay:
Definition: The average cost weight per stay, calculated as the total cost weight divided by the number of stays.

-Length Of Stays (LOS):
The average length of patient stays in the hospital, measured in days.

-Number of Outpatient Stays:
The total count of stays where patients were treated as outpatients.

-Number of Inpatient Stays:
The total count of stays where patients were treated as inpatients.


## Datasource :
Dataset: [Healthcare](https://github.com/kirannavale/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Healthcare%20Dashboard/HealthCare.xlsx)

About Dataset -
Healthcare data sets include a vast amount of medical data, various measurements, financial data, statistical data, demographics of specific populations, and insurance data, to name just a few, gathered from various healthcare data sources.
Health care data sets are an important source of information for understanding health disparities and addressing health inequities in patient populations.

## Data Preparation:

Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.
Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in the power query editor as follows:

- Removed Unnecessary columns
- Removed Unnecessary rows
- In Data Cleaning the first columns are promoted as headers and data types of the columns are changed

# Insights/Conclusion :
---
The average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) is often used as an indicator of efficiency. All other things being equal, a shorter stay will reduce the cost per discharge and shift care from inpatient to less expensive post-acute settings. The ALOS refers to the average number of days that patients spend in hospital. It is generally measured by dividing the total number of days stayed by all inpatients during a year by the number of admissions or discharges. Day cases are excluded. The indicator is presented both for all acute care cases and for childbirth without complications.
